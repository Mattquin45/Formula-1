        <h2> Our History</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Early 20th Century Motorsport: The roots of Formula 1 can be traced back to the early 1900s, when motor racing gained popularity across Europe, particularly in France and Italy. By the 1920s and 1930s, Grand Prix racing had become a prominent form of motorsport.</li>

            <li>Pre-War Grand Prix Racing: Prior to World War II, various European nations organized Grand Prix races, though they were conducted without a standardized set of rules, leading to a diverse and fragmented racing landscape.</li>

            <li>Post-War Reconstruction: Following World War II, there was a concerted effort to unify and formalize motor racing. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) took a leading role in establishing a standardized set of regulations for this purpose.</li>

            <li>Establishment of Formula 1 (1946): In 1946, the FIA introduced a new set of regulations known as "Formula A," which was later renamed "Formula 1." This was designed to be the premier category of single-seater car racing, with the goal of creating a cohesive global championship.</li>

            <li>First Formula 1 Race (1947): The first official race under the Formula 1 regulations took place in 1947 at the Circuito di Torino in Italy, though it was not yet part of a world championship.</li>

            <li>Inaugural World Championship (1950): The FIA officially launched the Formula 1 World Championship in 1950. The inaugural race was held at Silverstone in the United Kingdom, marking the beginning of what would become the pinnacle of motorsport.</li>

            <li>Dominance of Early Teams: The early years of Formula 1 were characterized by the dominance of Italian manufacturers such as Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, and Maserati. Drivers like Giuseppe Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio became iconic figures during this period.</li>

            <li>Growth and Evolution: Over the ensuing decades, Formula 1 evolved through technological advancements, stricter safety regulations, and the inclusion of races across various continents, solidifying its status as a global motorsport phenomenon.</li></p>
